chapter2 :

How building your vocabulary will enrich
your thinking, increase your self-assurance
in speaking and writing, and give you a
better understanding of the world and of
yourself; why it is necessary to recapture
the "powerful urge to learn"; why your age
makes little difference; how this book is
designed to build a college-size vocabulary
in two to three months.
